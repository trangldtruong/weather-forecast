# WEATHER FORECAST  

## Description
This application provides information on weather of a certain city for the current day and the next five days. All the API calls from this app are from OpenWeather. The first API call is used to pull information on latitude and longitude of users' input city. A second API is called to use the city's coordinate to find the current weather. Finally, the last API fetch is used to pull the next 5 days forecast of that city. 

## Usage 
Users can enter city name at input and click on search button. Weather information on wind, temperature and humidity will be displayed. Also, 5 days weather forecast of the city will be displayed below the current weather. Search history will be stored in LocalStorage.
